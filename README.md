Deep Leaning Project 


 Work flow :
 dataset : gtzan dataset 
 models : Undercomplete Autoencoder (AE)
         : CNN 
         : LSTM
         : Multi Layer Perceptron ( MLP )
         
Training 1  : Train Undercomplete Autoencoder and test accuracy .
         : Use latent space of undercomplete AE and  use it as input for CNN .
         : CNN training will give classification accuracy

Training 2 : Traing the lstm and use test . 

Training 3: Combine use of the output of trained models of LSTM and ( CNN + AE ) as input in MLP
          : final accuracy of from MLP is more than CNN and LSTM accuracy .
